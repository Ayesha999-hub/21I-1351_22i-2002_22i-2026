Mapper:

The mapper starts by importing necessary modules (sys for handling system arguments and re for regular expressions).
It defines a regular expression WORD_RE to match words in the input text.
The mapper reads the query from the command-line arguments and preprocesses it by converting it to lowercase and tokenizing it into words using the regular expression.
For each line of input (representing a document), the mapper extracts the article ID and the TF-IDF vector from the input.
It converts the TF-IDF vector from a string representation to a dictionary using eval() function.
The mapper calculates the relevance score for the document by iterating over each word in the query and checking if it exists in the document's TF-IDF vector.
If a word is found, it multiplies the TF-IDF weight of the query word by the TF-IDF weight of the document word and adds it to the relevance score.
Finally, the mapper emits the article ID and the relevance score for the document.
Reducer:

The reducer is not needed for this task, as it simply passes through the input received from the mapper.
Execution:

To execute this code, you would typically use a MapReduce framework such as Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark.
The input would consist of the query and the TF-IDF vectors of the documents.
The output would be a list of article IDs with their corresponding relevance scores, indicating the relevance of each document to the query.
Overall Functionality:

The relevance analyzer calculates a relevance score between a query and each document based on the similarity of their TF-IDF vectors.
The TF-IDF vector represents the importance of each word in a document relative to a collection of documents.
The relevance score indicates how relevant each document is to the query, with higher scores indicating higher relevance.
Improvements:

The code could be improved by using a more efficient way to calculate the relevance score, such as using numpy arrays for vector operations.
Error handling could be added to handle cases where the TF-IDF vector is missing or malformed.
