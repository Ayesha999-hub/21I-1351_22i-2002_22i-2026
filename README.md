Word Enumeration:

Mapper (WordCountMapper):

Reads input text from standard input (stdin) line by line.
Tokenizes each line into words using a regular expression (WORD_RE).
Converts each word to lowercase and emits key-value pairs, where the word is the key and the value is 1 (indicating the word count).
Reducer (WordCountReducer):

Reads the intermediate key-value pairs from the mapper.
Aggregates the word counts by summing up the values for each word.
Emits the final word count for each word.
Document Count:

Mapper (DocumentCountMapper):

Reads input text from stdin line by line, splitting each line into article ID and text.
Tokenizes the text into words using a regular expression (WORD_RE).
Converts each word to lowercase and emits key-value pairs, where the word is the key and the value is the article ID.
Reducer (DocumentCountReducer):

Reads the intermediate key-value pairs from the mapper.
Maintains a set of unique article IDs for each word.
Emits the word and the count of unique article IDs for each word.
Indexer:

Mapper (IndexerMapper):

Reads input text from stdin line by line, splitting each line into article ID and text.
Tokenizes the text into words using a regular expression (WORD_RE).
Converts each word to lowercase and calculates the TF-IDF weight for each word.
Emits key-value pairs, where the key is the article ID and the value is a tuple containing the word and its TF-IDF weight.
Reducer (IndexerReducer):

Reads the intermediate key-value pairs from the mapper.
Aggregates the TF-IDF weights for each word in each document.
Emits the article ID and the TF-IDF vector for each document.
Overall, this MapReduce framework can be used to process large text datasets and perform operations such as word counting, document counting, and TF-IDF calculation for document indexing. It demonstrates the basic principles of MapReduce programming for text analysis tasks.
